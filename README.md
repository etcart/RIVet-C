# RIVet


RIVet is a low level natural language processing toolkit for the Random 
Index Vector system.  This system is for document labelling and other 
text processing with:

  - Intuitive word relations 
  - Extreme lexical flexibility
  - Long-term cumulative improvement

# Why C?
The above benefits looks nice, but they come at the cost of: 
- extreme dimensionalities

So we have, in C, the extreme power to match.  Don't worry though, this 
library strives to remove all mallocs, frees, and pointer magic from the 
coder's space, freeing you up to ignore the technicalities and get to 
work
# Coming Soon!

  - Full scale standard lexicon for general use in higher level 
comparisons

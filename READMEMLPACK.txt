Here you will find a fully operational (if optimizable) C library of tools for working with the 
Random Index Vector ML System.  see the README for details on what and why
I propose to: 
1. translate this system into CPP and contribute it to the mlpack
2. translate and expand upon the set of applications already created, again into CPP and contribute it tangentially
3. build interfaces between this library and higher level, more accessible languages like python, 
to bring the extreme power and efficiency of this implimentation to a broader audience
